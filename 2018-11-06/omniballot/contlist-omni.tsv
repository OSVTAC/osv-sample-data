303	header	57409	header-11		STATE PROPOSITIONS	
305	question	57353	314		1	<strong>AUTHORIZES BONDS TO FUND SPECIFIED HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS. LEGISLATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Authorizes $4 billion in general obligation bonds for existing affordable housing programs for low-income residents, veterans, farmworkers, manufactured and mobile homes, infill, and transit-oriented housing. Fiscal Impact: Increased state costs to repay bonds averaging about $170 million annually over the next 35 years.
310	question	57354	104		2	<strong>AUTHORIZES BONDS TO FUND EXISTING HOUSING PROGRAM FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. LEGISLATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Amends Mental Health Services Act to fund No Place Like Home Program, which finances housing for individuals with mental illness. Ratifies existing law establishing the No Place Like Home Program. Fiscal Impact: Allows the state to use up to $140 million per year of county mental health funds to repay up to $2 billion in bonds. These bonds would fund housing for those with mental illness who are homeless.
315	question	57355	105		3	<strong>AUTHORIZES BONDS TO FUND PROJECTS FOR WATER SUPPLY AND QUALITY, WATERSHED, FISH, WILDLIFE, WATER CONVEYANCE, AND GROUNDWATER SUSTAINABILITY AND STORAGE. INITIATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Authorizes $8.877 billion in state general obligation bonds for various infrastructure projects. Fiscal Impact: Increased state costs to repay bonds averaging $430 million per year over 40 years. Local government savings for water-related projects, likely averaging a couple hundred million dollars annually over the next few decades.
320	question	57356	106		4	<strong>AUTHORIZES BONDS FUNDING CONSTRUCTION AT HOSPITALS PROVIDING CHILDREN&rsquo;S HEALTH CARE. INITIATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Authorizes $1.5 billion in bonds, to be repaid from state&rsquo;s General Fund, to fund grants for construction, expansion, renovation, and equipping of qualifying children&rsquo;s hospitals. Fiscal Impact: Increased state costs to repay bonds averaging about $80 million annually over the next 35 years.
325	question	57357	107		5	<strong>CHANGES REQUIREMENTS FOR CERTAIN PROPERTY OWNERS TO TRANSFER THEIR PROPERTY TAX BASE TO REPLACEMENT PROPERTY. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT AND STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Removes certain transfer requirements for homeowners over 55, severely disabled homeowners, and contaminated or disaster-destroyed property. Fiscal Impact: Schools and local governments each would lose over $100 million in annual property taxes early on, growing to about $1 billion per year. Similar increase in state costs to backfill school property tax losses.
330	question	57358	108		6	<strong>ELIMINATES CERTAIN ROAD REPAIR AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. REQUIRES CERTAIN FUEL TAXES AND VEHICLE FEES BE APPROVED BY THE ELECTORATE. INITIATIVE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.&nbsp;</strong>Repeals a 2017 transportation law&rsquo;s taxes and fees designated for road repairs and public transportation. Fiscal Impact: Reduced ongoing revenues of $5.1 billion from state fuel and vehicle taxes that mainly would have paid for highway and road maintenance and repairs, as well as transit programs.
335	question	57359	486		7	<strong>CONFORMS CALIFORNIA DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME TO FEDERAL LAW. ALLOWS LEGISLATURE TO CHANGE DAYLIGHT SAVING TIME PERIOD. LEGISLATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Gives Legislature ability to change daylight saving time period by two-thirds vote, if changes are consistent with federal law. Fiscal Impact: This measure has no direct fiscal effect because changes to daylight saving time would depend on future actions by the Legislature and potentially the federal government.
340	question	57360	691		8	<strong>REGULATES AMOUNTS OUTPATIENT KIDNEY DIALYSIS CLINICS CHARGE FOR DIALYSIS TREATMENT. INITIATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Requires rebates and penalties if charges exceed limit. Requires annual reporting to the state.

Fiscal Impact: Overall annual effect on state and local governments ranging from net positive impact in the low tens of millions of dollars to net negative impact in the tens of millions of dollars.
345	question	62279	prop9		9	<div title="Page 5"><p>Proposition 9 was removed from the ballot by order of the California Supreme Court. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div>
350	question	57361	692		10	<strong>EXPANDS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS&rsquo; AUTHORITY TO ENACT RENT CONTROL&nbsp;</strong><strong>ON RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY. INITIATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Repeals state law that currently restricts the scope of rent-control policies that cities and other local jurisdictions may impose on residential property. Fiscal Impact: Potential net reduction in state and local revenues of tens of millions of dollars per year in the long term. Depending on actions by local communities, revenue losses could be less or considerably more.
355	question	57362	693		11	<strong>REQUIRES PRIVATE-SECTOR EMERGENCY AMBULANCE EMPLOYEES TO REMAIN ON-CALL DURING WORK BREAKS. ELIMINATES CERTAIN EMPLOYER LIABILITY. INITIATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Law entitling hourly employees to breaks without being on-call would not apply to private-sector ambulance employees. Fiscal Impact: Likely fiscal benefit to local governments (in the form of lower costs and higher revenues), potentially in the tens of millions of dollars each year.
360	question	57363	694		12	<strong>ESTABLISHES NEW STANDARDS FOR CONFINEMENT OF SPECIFIED FARM ANIMALS; BANS SALE OF NONCOMPLYING PRODUCTS. INITIATIVE STATUTE.&nbsp;</strong>Establishes minimum requirements for confining certain farm animals. Prohibits sales of meat and egg products from animals confined in noncomplying manner. Fiscal Impact: Potential decrease in state income tax revenues from farm businesses, likely not more than several million dollars annually. State costs up to $10 million annually to enforce the measure.

365	question	57364	498		A	SAN FRANCISCO SEAWALL EARTHQUAKE SAFETY BOND, 2018. To protect the waterfront, BART and Muni, buildings, historic piers, and roads from earthquakes, flooding and rising seas by: repairing the 100 year old Embarcadero Seawall; strengthening the Embarcadero; and fortifying transit infrastructure and utilities serving residents and businesses; shall the city issue $425,000,000 in bonds, with a duration up to 30 years from the time of issuance, an estimated tax rate of $0.013/$100 of assessed property value, and estimated annual revenues of up to $40,000,000, with citizen oversight and regular audits? The City&rsquo;s current debt management policy is to keep the property tax rate from City general obligation bonds below the 2006 rate by issuing new bonds as older ones are retired and the tax base grows, though the overall property tax rate may vary based on other factors.
370	question	57365	499		B	Shall the City amend the Charter to include privacy guidelines and require the City Administrator to propose a privacy ordinance consistent with the guidelines to the Board of Supervisors?
375	question	57366	511		C	Shall the City impose additional business taxes to create a dedicated fund to support services for homeless people and prevent homelessness, including one tax of 0.175% to 0.69% on gross receipts over $50 million that a business receives in San Francisco, and another tax of 1.5% on certain administrative offices&rsquo; payroll expense in San Francisco, raising an estimated $250-300 million in combined tax revenues annually, and with no expiration date for these taxes?
380	question	57367	512		D	Shall the City impose new cannabis business taxes beginning in 2021, at rates ranging from 1% to 5% on gross receipts of cannabis businesses in San Francisco, where the Board of Supervisors could decrease those rates, or increase them up to 7%; and shall the City apply many of its business taxes to businesses with over $500,000 in gross receipts in San Francisco that do not have a physical presence here; raising an estimated $2-4 million annually in combined tax revenues in 2019 and 2020, and an estimated $7-16 million annually beginning in 2021, and with no expiration date on these newly imposed and applied taxes?
385	question	57368	513		E	Shall the City annually distribute up to 1.5% of the current base hotel tax for specific arts and cultural purposes, without increasing the existing hotel tax?
